# STAR-Load

[STAR-Load](http://marvel.com/universe/Star-Lord_%28Peter_Quill%29) is a wrapper script for [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), to execute via [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) with option *--genomeLoad LoadandKeep*. The problem is described [here](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues/367).
